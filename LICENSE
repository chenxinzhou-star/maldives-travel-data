CC0 1.0 Universal

Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

The person associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that
he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily
elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its
terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work
and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.

No Copyright

The Affirmer, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, hereby
overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons,
and surrenders all of the Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and
associated claims and causes of action in and to the Work.
